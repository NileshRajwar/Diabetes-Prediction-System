Addressing the global challenge of diabetes, this project utilizes data mining techniques, including Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Decision Trees, to predict diabetes based on parameters such as Glucose level, blood pressure, and BMI. The initiative aims to enhance early detection and improve accuracy in identifying individuals at risk, ultimately contributing to proactive healthcare measures and better patient outcomes.
